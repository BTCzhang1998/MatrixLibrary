# MatrixLibary
I implemented this matrix library in C#, which can be used to do matrix computation and solve linear equations.

The main algorithms in the matrix library are as followings:

- LU Decomposition
- QR Decomposition
- Conjugate Gradient
- Gauss Elimination
- Linear Least Squares

Since the numerical calculation packages on the .Net platform are very limited, some developers used this library as a lightweight choice.
